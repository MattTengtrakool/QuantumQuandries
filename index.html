    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Players alternate turns, each turn consists of placing a chip on any empty cell and then drawing a Quantum card.</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to control as many rows, columns or diagonals as possible. A player controls a line if they have more chips in it than their opponent.</p>
    <h3>Quantum Cards</h3>
    <p>After placing a chip, players draw a Quantum card. They can choose to play it immediately or save it for a future turn. Players can only hold up to 3 Quantum cards in their hand.</p>
    <p>The game ends when all chips have been placed on the board or when the Quantum deck runs out. The player who controls the most lines is the winner.</p>
